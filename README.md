Since the task was to find the price, we chose a regression (as opposed to classification) algorithm. 
After some research and tests with Linear Regression and SGD, we discovered their score was around 23%; clearly not enough.
We did, however, find that Decision Tree Regression - despite it having overfit - gave us the best result with the predictions.
After testing all three (all code documented in the Jupyter Notebook file), we decided to fulfill the task with Decision Tree Regression.
